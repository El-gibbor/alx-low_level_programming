# Even more pointers, strings and arrays  
This project aims to provide an understanding of pointers to pointers, multidimensional arrays, and common C standard library functions for string manipulation. I was able to have a good grasp of the below concepts at the end of the tasks given.  
* __[Pointers to Pointers]:__(https://beginnersbook.com/2014/01/c-pointer-to-pointer/) Understand the concept of pointers to pointers and learn how to use them effectively in C programming.  
* __[Multidimensional Arrays]__(https://beginnersbook.com/2014/01/2d-arrays-in-c-example/): Learn about multidimensional arrays in C, including their declaration, initialization, and usage.  
* __C Standard Library Functions:__ Gain knowledge of the most common C standard library functions used to manipulate strings.
