# Even more pointers, strings and arrays  
This project aims to provide an understanding of pointers to pointers, multidimensional arrays, and common C standard library functions for string manipulation. And I was able to have a good grasp of the below concepts at the end of the tasks given.  
* __[Pointers to Pointers](https://beginnersbook.com/2014/01/c-pointer-to-pointer/):__ Understood the concept of pointers to pointers and learn how to use them effectively in C programming.  
* __[Multidimensional Arrays](https://beginnersbook.com/2014/01/2d-arrays-in-c-example/):__ Learned about multidimensional arrays in C, including their declaration, initialization, and usage.  
* __C Standard Library Functions:__ Gained knowledge of the most common C standard library functions used to manipulate strings.
