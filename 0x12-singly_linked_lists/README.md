# C - Singly Linked Lists  
This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide and implementation of linked lists in the C programming language. With the task excersies in this project, we covered the fundamental concepts of linked lists, including when and why to use linked lists over arrays, as well as sequentially implementing how to build and utilize linked lists effectively.   
## Learning Objectives  
By exploring this project, we are expected to internalize the below learning objectives:  
* __Understand the concept of linked lists:__ Gain a clear understanding of what linked lists are and how they differ from arrays. Learn about the structure and organization of linked lists, including nodes and pointers.
* __Implement a linked list:__ Learn how to build a linked list from scratch in C. Explore the essential operations, such as creating a list, inserting elements, deleting elements, and traversing the list.    
* __Determine when to use linked lists:__ Recognize the scenarios where linked lists are more suitable than arrays. Understand the advantages and disadvantages of linked lists, such as dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertions/deletions.  
* __Perform common operations on linked lists:__ Acquire the knowledge required to perform various operations on linked lists, such as searching for an element, updating values, sorting elements, and merging lists.  
* __Handle edge cases and memory management:__ Understand how to handle edge cases, such as empty lists, inserting at the beginning or end, and dealing with memory allocation and deallocation in linked lists.  

* __Gain proficiency in linked list usage:__ Develop a strong foundation in using linked lists effectively by implementing practical examples and exercises. and look out to apply the knowledge gained to solve real-world programming problems.
