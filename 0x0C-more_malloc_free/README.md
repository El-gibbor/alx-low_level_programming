# More on C - Malloc_Free  
This project builds upon our [previous](https://github.com/El-gibbor/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x0B-malloc_free) exploration of dynamic memory allocation using malloc and free in the C programming language. We will now delve deeper into these concepts and further explore other related functions, such as calloc, realloc, and exit.   
## Core Objectives 
The main objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive understanding and practical implementation of the following concepts:   
* __Understanding how to use the `exit` function:__ The exit function is a part of the C standard library and is used to terminate the program execution. It allows you to explicitly exit from your program at any point, bypassing any remaining code. The exit function takes an integer argument, which represents the exit status of the program. By convention, a return value of 0 indicates successful program execution, while non-zero values indicate errors or exceptional conditions  
* __`calloc` and `realloc` functions:__  
    * __Calloc:__ `void *calloc(size_t nitems, size_t size)` allocates the requested memory and returns a pointer to it. The difference in `malloc` and `calloc` is that `malloc` does not set the memory to zero where as `calloc` sets allocated memory to zero.  
    * __Realloc:__ `void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size)`The realloc function is used to resize the memory block previously allocated with malloc, calloc, or realloc itself. It takes two arguments: a pointer to the previously allocated memory block and the new size in bytes. 
  
* __Typecasting the result of malloc:__ The topic of whether to typecast the return value of malloc is a subject of debate among programmers in the C ecosystem. In modern C programming, it is generally recommended to omit the typecast, as it is unnecessary and can potentially hide errors. However, opinions on this matter may vary. We will explore the potential drawbacks and implications of typecasting, providing insights into both perspectives.
