# C - preprocessor  
This project aims to provide an overview of the C preprocessor and cover the following objectives:  
* Understanding macros and their usage in C programming.
* Familiarizing yourself with commonly used predefined macros.
* Learning how to implement include guards to prevent multiple inclusion of header files.  
## General  
The C preprocessor is a tool that performs text substitution in your C source code before it goes through the compilation process. It helps in writing more efficient and flexible code by allowing you to define macros and utilize them throughout your program.  
## Macros
Macros in C are used to define symbolic constants or to perform text substitution. They are created using the #define directive and can take arguments. When the macro is used in the code, it gets replaced with the corresponding value or code defined in the macro.  
```
#define PI 3.14159
#define MAX(x, y) ((x) > (y) ? (x) : (y))

// Usage
float radius = 5.0;
float circumference = 2 * PI * radius;

int a = 10, b = 20;
int max_value = MAX(a, b);
```
