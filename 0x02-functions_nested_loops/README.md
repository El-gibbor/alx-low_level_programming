# C - Functions, nested loops  
This project focuses on deepening ones understanding of C programming, specifically on topics related to functions, nested loops, variable scope, gcc flags, and header files. The objective is to develop ones skills by creating custom functions from scratch, without relying on standard library functions like printf, puts, gets, strlen, strcpy, and others.

## Learning Objectives  
I was able to get myself acquainted with the below concepts:  
* __Nested Loops:__ Understood the concept of nested loops and how they can be used to create complex iterations and patterns in C programming.  
* __Functions:__ Learned about functions in C, their purpose, syntax, and how to use them to organize code into reusable modules.  
* __Declaration vs. Definition of Functions:__ Differentiate between the declaration and definition of a function, understanding their roles and when to use each.
* __Prototypes:__ Understood the concept of function prototypes, their importance in providing a forward declaration of a function, and how they relate to function definition.  
* __Variable Scope:__ Master the concept of variable scope in C programming, including global and local scopes, and understand how variables are accessed and managed within different scopes.
* __GCC Flags:__ Learned about commonly used GCC flags such as -Wall, -Werror, -pedantic, -Wextra, and -std=gnu89, their purposes, and how to utilize them for efficient code compilation and error handling.  
* __Header Files:__ Understand the role of header files in C programming, how to create and include them using the #include directive, and their significance in modular code development.  
## Feel free to Use  
The repository contains code examples and exercises that will help anyone grasp the concepts mentioned above. Feel free to explore the code, make modifications, and run it to observe the outcomes. Experimentation and hands-on practice are key to solidify ones understanding.  
But to my Successors or peers in Alx, please dont verbatimely copy and paste the codes just to pass your checks. That's self-deciet and its downtown dangerous to your career.
