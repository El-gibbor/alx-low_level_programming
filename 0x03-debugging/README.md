# C - Debugging  
This is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevent it from running correctly. As I progress as a programmer and become an industry engineer, I will learn and get my hands on how to use debugging tools such as gdb or built-in tools available in IDEs. However, it's essential I grasp the concepts and processes of manual debugging first.

## Core Objectives  
I was able to solve and debug the errors that was intentionally placed in the code snippetes in this repo and was able to unconsciously assimilate the below concepts:
* __Debugging:__ Understood the concept of debugging and its significance in the software development process.
* __Methods of manual debugging:__ Familiarized myself with various methods and techniques for debugging code manually, including strategies like rubber duck debugging and other effective approaches.  
* __Reading error messages:__ Learned how to interpret error messages generated by the compiler or runtime environment, and use them as valuable clues to identify and resolve issues in your code.
