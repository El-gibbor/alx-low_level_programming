# C - Recursion  
Recursion is a powerful programming technique that involves solving a problem by breaking it down into smaller, self-similar and simpler instances of the same problem.
In this project, we will explore the concept of recursion and how it can be applied in various scenarios.  
## Core Objectives  
The goal of this project is to help us develop a strong comprehension of recursion and its implementation.
By the end of the project, we are expected to be comfortable with the below concepts without relying on external resources:  
* Understanding the fundamental concept of recursion
* Effectively implementing recursive functions in code
* Identifying appropriate scenarios for utilizing recursion
* Recognizing situations where recursion may not be the optimal approach
