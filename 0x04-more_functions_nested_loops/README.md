# More nested loops and functions in C  
A further and deeper delve into the concepts of C nested loops, Functions, variable scopes, header files. Now advanced to create more intresting functions from scratch without the use of any standar library.  
## Functions like:  
* `int _isupper(int c)` that checks for uppercase character 
* `int _isdigit(int c)` a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9)  
* `int mul(int a, int b)` a function that multiplies two integers  
* `void print_line(int n)` a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.  
* `void print_diagonal(int n)` a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.
* `int print_square(int size)` a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.  
* `void print_numbers(void)` a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.  
*  `void more_numbers(void)` a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line. 
*  `void print_triangle(int size)` a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.  
* `void print_number(int n)` a function that prints an integer without using any standard library function, not allowed to use long, arrays or pointers and als not hardcoding any special value.  
* Wrote the Fizz-Buzz test: a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`, Each number or word should be separated by a space and this task was done without the use of standard library as instructed.
