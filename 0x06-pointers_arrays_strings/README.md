# More Pointers, Arrays and Strings in C  
Now we advanced more into the precedent [project](https://github.com/El-gibbor/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings) implementing the previous various concepts in C programming, which includes but not limited to pointers, arrays, strings, and variable scope in a more exciting and advanced level. Creating more functions from scratch. such as:
* `int _strcmp(char *s1, char *s2)` a function that compares two strings. works exactly like `strcmp`  
* `char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src)` a function that concatenates two strings.  
*  `char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n)` similar to similar to the above `_strcat` function, except that it will use at most `n` bytes from `src`; and src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains `n` or more bytes.  
*  `char *_strncpy(char *dest, char *src, int n)` a function that copies a string. works exactly like `strncp`  
*  `void reverse_array(int *a, int n)` function that reverses the content of an array of integers Where `n` is the number of elements of the array  
*  `char *string_toupper(char *)` a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.  
*  `char *cap_string(char *)` a function that capitalizes all words of a string. Separators of words: space, tabulation, new line, `,, ;, ., !, ?, ", (, ), {,` and `}`  
*  `char *leet(char *)` a function that encodes a string into 1337. only allowed to use one `if` in the code, two loops in your not allowed to use switch, not allowed to use any ternary operation.ðŸ˜ž  
*  `char *rot13(char *)` a function that encodes a string using rot13. written and also taking the formal restrictions of `char *leet(char *)` into account  
*  `void print_number(int n)` a function that prints an integer. without the use of long, pointers and arrays or hardcoding any special values.  
## Core Objectives  
Upon completion of the tasks in this module, I gained proficiency in the following areas:  
* [Pointers](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_pointers.htm): Understood the concept of pointers and learned how to use them effectively in C programming.  
* [Arrays](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_arrays.htm): Learned the fundamentals of arrays and explored different use cases for efficient data storage and manipulation.  
* [Pointers vs. Arrays](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pointer-vs-array-in-c/): Differentiate between pointers and arrays, understood their similarities and differences in C programming.  
* [Strings](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_strings.htm): Gained knowledge on working with strings in C programming, including string manipulation and common string operations.  
* [Variable Scope](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/scope-of-variables-in-c-local-and-global-scope-explained/#:~:text=In%20simple%20terms%2C%20scope%20of,used%2C%20and%20can%20be%20modified.): Mastered the concept of variable scope and understood the lifetime and visibility of variables in different scopes.  
## Feel free to Use  
The repository contains code examples and exercises that will help anyone grasp the concepts mentioned above. Feel free to explore the code, make modifications, and run it to observe the outcomes. Experimentation and hands-on practice are key to solidify ones understanding. But to my Successors or peers in alx, dont verbatimely copy and paste the codes just to pass your checks. That's self-deciet and its downtown dangerous to anyone's career.  
## Resources  
Here are some additional resources I used to further enhance my understanding of the topics covered in this project:
* [Pointers In C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuegQmMdy8M&t=3922s) by Harsha and Animesh from [MyCodeSchool](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/mycodeschool-youtube-channel-history/)
