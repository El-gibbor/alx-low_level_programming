# C - Variables, if, else, while  
Focused on learning the fundamentals of C programming, covering topics such as arithmetic operators, logical operators, relational operators, boolean operators, control flow statements, variable declaration and assignment, printing values, using loops, and understanding the ASCII character set.

## Core Objectives  
I was able to explain the following concepts without relying on external resources upon completion of this project:  
* [Arithmetic Operators](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_arithmetic_operators.htm): Understoood the different arithmetic operators in C and how to use them for mathematical calculations.  
* [Logical Operators](https://www.fresh2refresh.com/c-programming/c-operators-expressions/c-logical-operators/): Learned about boolean operators in C, their usage in logical expressions, and how they evaluate to true or false.  
* [Relational Operators](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_relational_operators.htm): Gained knowledge of relational operators in C and their application in comparing values and determining relationships between them.  
* [Control Flow Statements](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/if_else_statement_in_c.htm): Learned how to use if and if-else statements to control the flow of execution based on specific conditions.

* Comments: Understand the importance of comments in code documentation and how to effectively use them.  
* Variable Declaration: Gained proficiency in declaring variables of different types, including char, int, and unsigned int.  
* Variable Assignment: Learned how to assign values to variables in C programming.  
* Printing Values: Master the usage of printf function to print values of variables with different types.  
* [While Loop](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_while_loop.htm): Understood the syntax and functionality of the while loop and its application in repetitive execution.
ASCII Character Set: Familiarized myself with the ASCII character set and its significance in representing characters in computer systems.  
* GCC Flags: Learn about the purpose and usage of GCC flags, specifically -m32 and -m64, in compiling C code for different architectures.
