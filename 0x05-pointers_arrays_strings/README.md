# C Pointers, Arrays and Strings  
Focuses on understanding and implementing various concepts in C programming, including pointers, arrays, strings, and variable scope  
## Core Objectives  
Upon completion of the tasks in this module, I gained proficiency in the following areas:  
* [Pointers](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_pointers.htm): Understood the concept of pointers and learned how to use them effectively in C programming.  
* [Arrays](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_arrays.htm): Learned the fundamentals of arrays and explored different use cases for efficient data storage and manipulation.  
* [Pointers vs. Arrays](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pointer-vs-array-in-c/): Differentiate between pointers and arrays, understood their similarities and differences in C programming.  
* [Strings](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_strings.htm): Gained knowledge on working with strings in C programming, including string manipulation and common string operations.  
* [Variable Scope](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/scope-of-variables-in-c-local-and-global-scope-explained/#:~:text=In%20simple%20terms%2C%20scope%20of,used%2C%20and%20can%20be%20modified.): Mastered the concept of variable scope and understood the lifetime and visibility of variables in different scopes.  
## Feel free to Use  
The repository contains code examples and exercises that will help anyone grasp the concepts mentioned above. Feel free to explore the code, make modifications, and run it to observe the outcomes. Experimentation and hands-on practice are key to solidify ones understanding. But to my Successors or peers in alx, dont verbatimely copy and paste the codes just to pass your checks. That's self-deciet and its downtown dangerous to anyone's career.  
## Resources  
Here are some additional resources I used to further enhance my understanding of the topics covered in this project:
* [Pointers In C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuegQmMdy8M&t=3922s) by Harsha and Animesh from [MyCodeSchool](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/mycodeschool-youtube-channel-history/)
