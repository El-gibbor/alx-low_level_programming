# C Low-Level Programming  
Welcome to my C Low-Level Programming repository! This repository serves as a collection of projects and exercises for all [Alx](https://www.alxafrica.com/) Software Engineering trainees, focused on low-level programming concepts using the C language. This track is designed to provide a solid foundation in understanding the inner workings of your programs, memory management, and a deeper understanding of the intricacies of computer systems.
