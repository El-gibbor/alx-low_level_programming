# C - Malloc, Free  
For this project, we will be focusing on the following concepts:  
* __Automatic and dynamic allocation:__ Understanding the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation of memory in C.  
* __malloc and free:__ Learning about the `malloc` and `free` functions and how to use them for dynamic memory allocation.  
* __Memory leak detection:__ Using tools like Valgrind to check for memory leaks in our code.  
## Core Objectives  
This project aims to give a clear and concise understanding of the the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation, understanding the distinction between automatic allocation, where memory is allocated automatically for local variables, and dynamic allocation, where memory is allocated manually using functions like `malloc`. giving a clear understanding of the purpose and usage of `malloc` and free in C. Knowing how to allocate memory dynamically using `malloc` and how to release the allocated memory using `free`. below are a few more objectives  
* __When and why to use malloc:__ Understanding the scenarios where dynamic memory allocation is required and the advantages it offers over automatic allocation. Be able to determine when it is appropriate to use `malloc` to allocate memory for variables and data structures.  
* __Using Valgrind for memory leak detection:__ Learn how to utilize Valgrind, a popular memory debugging tool, to detect memory leaks in C programs. Understand how to interpret Valgrind's output and identify and fix memory leaks effectively.
